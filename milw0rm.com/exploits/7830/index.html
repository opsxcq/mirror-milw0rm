----

By default, the application provides public access to the text file which stores the MD5 hashes of the username/password and these can be found at:

http://www.example.com/rcblog/config/password.txt

These two hashes represent the username (first) and the password (second).

By default these are 9d0aea34e0f22cff881feb82c79ce76a and e20eeabd7d13800e1c30043b269fbc86 respectively.

We need two more hashes to fake the required credentials:

One is the MD5 hash of $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] which is in this case &quot;/rcblog&quot; -&gt; ad624ca84b593d66e3685e83e4a3618e

The other is the the MD5 hash of the public IP of the user, let's say &quot;192.168.1.5&quot; -&gt; 2e9e9f7c017ee2a1645a236d182fb28c

Finally we combine the hashes into one large string and craft it in a &quot;rcb_id&quot; cookie in the following order:

Directory -&gt; IP Address -&gt; Username -&gt; Password

Resulting in:

9d0aea34e0f22cff881feb82c79ce76ae20eeabd7d13800e1c30043b269fbc86ad624ca84b593d66e3685e83e4a3618e2e9e9f7c017ee2a1645a236d182fb28c

We are then logged in with administrative privileges.
