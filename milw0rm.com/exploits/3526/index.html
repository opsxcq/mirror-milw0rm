# Title: Cisco 7940 SIP INVITE remote DOS 
# Date: February 19, 2007 
# ID: KIPH2 
#
# Synopsis: After sending a cra fted INVITE message the device immediately 
# reboots. The phone does not check properly the sipURI field of the 
# Remote-Party-ID in the message. 
#
# The vendor was informed and acknowledged the vulnerability. This 
# vulnerability was identified by the Madynes research team at INRIA 
# Lorraine, using the Madynes VoIP fuzzer. 
#
# Background: SIP is the IETF standardized (RFCs 2543 and 3261) protocol 
# for VoIP signalization. SIP is an ASCII based INVITE message is used to 
# initiate and maintain a communication session. 
#
# Affected devices: Cisco phone 7940/7960 running firmware P0S3-07-4-00 
#
# Unaffected: devices running firmware POS8-6-0 
#
# Description: After receiving one crafted SIP INVITE message, the 
# affected device reboots immediately. The proof of concept code can be 
# used to demonstrate the vulnerability. 
#
# Resolution: 
#
# Fixed software is available from the vendor and customers following 
# recommended best practices (ie segregating VOIP traffic from data) will 
# be protected from malicious traffic in most situations.
