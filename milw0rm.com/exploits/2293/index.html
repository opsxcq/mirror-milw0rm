EDIT: Solution:


It looks like the vulnerable files are there in case you want to integrate with another script. The script that would require these files is AEDating:

you simply delete the following files and you will be secure:

/inc/cmses/aedating4CMS.php
/inc/cmses/aedatingCMS.php
/inc/cmses/aedatingCMS2.php

if your flashchat is integrated with AEDating and/or you dont want to delete the files you can just edit the 3 files to use your path like this:

Replace this:

$aed_root_path = realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../') . '/';
include($aed_root_path . 'inc/header.inc.php');
require_once( &quot;$dir[inc]db.inc.php&quot; );
require_once( &quot;$dir[inc]admin.inc.php&quot; );

With this:

$aed_root_path = realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../') . '/';
include($aed_root_path . 'inc/header.inc.php');
require_once( &quot;[Your AED path]/db.inc.php&quot; );
require_once( &quot;[Your AED path]/admin.inc.php&quot; );

Alternatively you could just upgrade to 4.6.2 (just released)

PS, all 3 of those files are vulnerable and will need editing.
