http://[HOST]/tbdev/tbdev-01-01-08/login.php?returnto=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K

HTML Injection:
1) http://[HOST]/tbdev/tbdev-01-01-08/my.php

2b) Affected Sites by HTML Injection:
http://[HOST]/tbdev/tbdev-01-01-08/userdetails.php?id=USERID

Internet Explorer 6 and perhaps 7 should be triggered by this.
Please see: http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html for more information.
Browser Tested: Internet Explorer 7 (FireFox 3 was tested for the other
vulnerabilities)

-:: Solution ::-
Secure redirection calls with referer headers (just an example) and
filter bad characters.

Conclusion:
This system was fun to find bad code in, it sure had a nice diversity of
vulnerabilities.
