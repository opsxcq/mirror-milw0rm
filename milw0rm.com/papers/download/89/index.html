NAME

Resorting to Sorting

SYNOPSIS

A guide to using Perl's sort() function to sort data in numerous ways.
Topics covered include the Orcish maneuver, the Schwartzian Transform,
the Guttman-Rosler Transform, radix sort, and sort-by-index.

DESCRIPTION

Sorting data is a common procedure in programming -- there are
efficient and inefficient ways to do this. Luckily, in Perl, the sort()
function does the dirty work; Perl's sorting is handled internally by a
combination of merge-sort and quick-sort. However, sorting is done, by
default, on strings. In order to change the way this is done, you can
supply a piece of code to the sort() function that describes the
machinations to take place.

We'll examine all differents sorts of sorts; some have been named after
programmers you may have heard of, and some have more descriptive
names.

CONTENT

Table of Contents
Na√Øve Sorting
Poor practices that cause Perl to do a lot more work than necessary.

The Orcish Maneuver
Joseph Hall's implementation of "memoization" in sorting.

Radix Sort
A multiple-pass method of sorting; the time it takes to run is linearly
proportional to the size of the largest element.

Sorting by Index
When multiple arrays must be sorted in parallel, save yourself trouble
and sort the indices.

Schwartzian Transforms
Wrapping a sort() in between two map()s -- one to set up a data
structure, and the other to extract the original information -- is a
nifty way of sorting data quickly, when expensive function calls need
to be kept to a minimum.

Guttman-Rosler Transforms
It's far simpler to let sort() sort as it will, and to format your data
as something meaningful to the string comparisons sort() makes.

Portability
By giving sorting functions a prototype, you can make sure they work
from anywhere!

Na√Øve Sorting

Ordinarily, it's not a difficult task to sort things. You merely pass
the list to sort(), and out comes a sorted list. Perl defaults to using
a string comparison, offered by the cmp operator. This operator
compares two scalars in ASCIIbetical order -- that means "1" comes
before "A", which comes before "^", which comes before "a". For a
detailed list of the order, see your nearest ascii(1) man page.

To sort numerically, you need to supply sort() that uses the numerical
comparison operator (dubbed the "spaceship" operator), <=>:

  @sorted = sort { $a <=> $b } @numbers;  # ascending order
  @sorted = sort { $b <=> $a } @numbers;  # descending order



There are two special variables used in sorting -- $a and $b. These
represent the two elements being compared at the moment. The sorting
routine can take a block (or a function name) to use in deciding which
order the list is to be sorted in. The block or function should return
-1 if $a is to come before $b, 0 if they are the same (or, more
correctly, if their position in the sorted list could be the same), and
1 if $a is to come after $b.

Sorting, by default, is like:

  @sorted = sort { $a cmp $b } @unsorted;



That is, ascending ASCIIbetical sorting. You can leave out the block in
that case:

  @sorted = sort @unsorted;



Now, if we had a list of strings, and we wanted to sort them, in a
case-insensitive manner. That means, we want to treat the strings as if
they were all lower-case or upper-case. We could do something like:

  @sorted = sort { lc($a) cmp lc($b) } @unsorted;
  # or
  @sorted = sort { uc($a) cmp uc($b) } @unsorted;


Note: There is a difference between these two sortings. There are some
punctuation characters that come after upper-case letters and before
lower-case characters. Thus, strings that start with such characters
would be placed differently in the sorted list, depending on whether we
use lc() or uc().

Now, this method of sorting is fine for small lists, but the lc() (or
uc()) function is called twice for each comparison. This might not seem
bad, but think about the consequences of performing massive
calculations on your data:

  sub age_or_name {
    my ($name_a, $age_a) = split /_/ => $a;
    my ($name_b, $age_b) = split /_/ => $b;
    return ($age_a <=> $age_b or $name_a cmp $name_b);
  }

  @people = qw( Jeff_19 Jon_14 Ray_18 Tim_14 Joan_20 Greg_19 );
  @sorted = sort age_or_name @people;
  # @sorted is now
  #   qw( Jon_14 Tim_14 Ray_18 Greg_19 Jeff_19 Joan_20 )



This gets to be tedious. There's obviously too much work being done. We
should only have to split the strings once.

Exercises
Create a sorting subroutine to sort by the length of a string, or, if
needed, by its first five characters.

  @sorted = sort { ... } @strings;



Sort the following data structure by the value of the key specified by
the "cmp" key:

  @nodes = (
    { id => 17, size => 300, keys => 2, cmp => 'keys' },
    { id => 14, size => 104, keys => 9, cmp => 'size' },
    { id => 31, size => 2045, keys => 43, cmp => 'keys' },
    { id => 28, size => 6, keys => 0, cmp => 'id' },
  );



The Orcish Maneuver

This method of speeding up sorting comparisons was named by Joseph
Hall. It uses a hash to cache values of the complex calculations you
need to make:

  {
    my %cache;	# cache hash is only seen by this function

    sub age_or_name {
      my $data_a =
	($cache{$a} ||= [ split /_/ => $a ]);
      my $data_b =
	($cache{$b} ||= [ split /_/ => $b ]);
      return (
	$data_a->[1] <=> $data_b->[1]
	or
	$data_a->[0] <=> $data_b->[0]
      );
    }
  }

  @people = qw( Jeff_19 Jon_14 Ray_18 Tim_14 Joan_20 Greg_19 );
  @sorted = sort age_or_name @people;



This procedure here uses a hash of array references to store the name
and age for each person. The first time a string is used in the sorting
subroutine, it doesn't have an entry in the %cache hash, so the || part
is used.

That is where this gets its name -- it is the OR-cache manuever, which
can be lovingly pronounced "orcish".

The main structure of Orcish sorting is:

  {
    my %cache;

    sub function {
      my $data_a = ($cache{$a} ||= mangle($a));
      my $data_b = ($cache{$b} ||= mangle($b));
      # compare as needed
    }
  }



where mangle() is some function that does the necessary calculations on
the data.

Exercises
Why should you make the caching hash viewable only by the sorting
function? And how is this accomplished?

Use the Orcish Manuever to sort a list of strings in the same way as
described in the first exercise from "Na√Øve Sorting".

Radix Sort

If you have a set of strings of constant width (or that can easily be
made in constant width), you can employ radix sort. This method gets
around calling Perl's sort() function altogether.

The concept of radix sort is as follows. Assume you have N strings of k
characters in length, and each character can have one of x values (for
ASCII, x is 256). We then create x "buckets", and each bucket can hold
at most N strings.

Here is a sample list of data for N = 7, k = 4, and x = 256: john,
bear, roar, boat, vain, vane, zany.

We then proceed to place each string into the bucket corresponding to
the ASCII value of its rightmost character. If we were then to print
the contents of the buckets after this first placement, our sample list
would look like: vane, john vain bear roar boat zany.

Then, we use the character immediately to the left of the one just
used, and put the strings in the buckets accordingly. This is done in
the order in which they are found in the buckets. The new list is:
bear, roar, boat, john, vain, vane, zany.

On the next round, the list becomes: vain, vane, zany, bear, roar,
boat, john.

On the final round, the list is: bear, boat, john, roar, vain, vane,
zany.

This amount of time this sorting takes is constant, and easily
calculated. If we assume that all the data is the same length, then we
take N strings, and multiply that by k characters. The algorithm also
uses some extra space for storing the strings -- it needs an extra Nk
bytes. If the data needs to be padded, there is some extra time
involved (if a character is undefined, it is set as a NUL ("\0")).

Here is a radix implementation. It returns the list it is given in
ASCIIbetical order, like sort @list would.

  # sorts in-place (meaning @list gets changed)
  # set $unknown to true to indicate variable length
  radix_sort(\@list, $unknown);



  sub radix_sort {
    my ($data, $k) = @_;
    $k = !!$k;	# turn any true value into 1

    if ($k) { $k < length and $k = length for @$data }
    else { $k = length $data->[0] }

    while ($k--) {
      my @buckets;
      for (@$data) {
	my $c = substr $_, $k, 1;  # get char
	$c = "\0" if not defined $c;
	push @{ $buckets[ord($c)] }, $_;
      }

      @$data = map @$_, @buckets;  # expand array refs
    }
  }



You'll notice the first argument to this function is an array
reference. By doing this, we save copying a potentially large list,
thus taking up less space, and running faster. If, for beauty reasons,
you'd prefer not to backslash your array, you could use prototypes:

  sub radix_sort (\@;$);

  radix_sort @list, $unknown;

  sub radix_sort (\@;$) {
    # ...
  }



You could combine the declaration and the definition of the function,
but the prototype must be seen before the function call.

Exercises
Why does radix sort start with the right-most character in a string?

Does the order of the elements in the input list effect the run-time of
this sorting algorithm? What happens if the elements are already
sorted? Or in the reverse sorted order?

Sorting by Index

Given the choice between sorting three lists and sorting one list,
you'd choose sorting one list, right? Good. This, then, is the strategy
employed when you sort by index. If you have three arrays that hold
different information, yet for a given index, the elements are all
related -- we say these arrays hold data in parallel -- then it seems
far too much work to sort all three arrays.

  @names  = qw( Jeff Jon Ray Tim Joan Greg );
  @ages   = qw( 19   14  18  14  20   19   );
  @gender = qw( m    m	 m   m	 f    m    );



Here, all the data at index 3 ("Tim", 14, "m") is related, as it is for
any other index. Now, if we wanted to sort these arrays so that this
relationship stood, but the lists were sorted in terms of age and then
by name, then we would like our data to look like:

  @names  = qw( Jon Tim Ray Greg Jeff Joan );
  @ages   = qw( 14  14	18  19	 19   20   );
  @gender = qw( m   m	m   m	 m    f    );



But to actually sort these lists requires 3 times the effort. Instead,
we will sort the indices of the arrays (from 0 to 5). This is the
function we will use:

  sub age_or_name {
    return (
      $ages[$a] <=> $ages[$b]
      or
      $names[$a] cmp $names[$b]
    )
  }



And here it is in action:

  @idx = sort age_or_name 0 .. $#ages;
  print "@ages\n";	  # 19 14 18 14 20 19
  print "@idx\n";	  #  1	3  2  5  0  4
  print "@ages[@idx]\n";  # 14 14 18 19 19 20



As you can see, the array isn't touched, but the indices are given in
such an order that fetching the elements of the array in that order
yields sorted data.
Note: the $#ages variable is related to the @ages array -- it holds the
highest index used in the array, so for an array of 6 elements, $#array
is 5.

Schwartzian Transforms

A common (and rather popular) idiom in Perl programming is the
Schwartzian Transform, an approach which is like "you set 'em up, I'll
knock 'em down!" It uses the map() function to transform the incoming
data into a list of simple data structures. This way, the machinations
done to the data set are only done once (as in the Orcish Manuever).

The general appearance of the transform is like so:

  @sorted =
    map { get_original_data($_) }
    sort { ... }
    map { transform_data($_) }
    @original;



They are to be read in reverse order, since the first thing done is the
map() that transforms the data, then the sorting, and then the map() to
get the original data back.

Let's say you had lines of a password file that were formatted as:

  username:password:shell:name:dir



and you wanted to sort first by shell, then by name, and then by
username. A Schwartzian Transform could be used like this:

  @sorted =
    map { $_->[0] }
    sort {
      $a->[3] cmp $b->[3]
      or
      $a->[4] cmp $b->[4]
      or
      $a->[1] cmp $b->[1]
    }
    map { [ $_, split /:/ ] }
    @entries;



We'll break this down into the individual parts.
Step 1. Transform your data.

We create a list of array references; each reference holds the original
record, and then each of the fields (as separated by colons).

  @transformed = map { [ $_, split /:/ ] } @entries;



That could be written in a for-loop, but understanding map() is a
powerful tool in Perl.

  for (@entries) {
    push @transformed, [ $_, split /:/ ];
  }



Step 2. Sort your data.

Now, we sort on the needed fields. Since the first element of our
references is the original string, the username is element 1, the name
is element 4, and the shell is element 3.

  @transformed = sort {
    $a->[3] cmp $b->[3]
    or
    $a->[4] cmp $b->[4]
    or
    $a->[1] cmp $b->[1]
  } @transformed;



Step 3. Restore your original data.

Finally, get the original data back from the structure:

  @sorted = map { $_->[0] } @transformed;



And that's all there is to it. It may look like a daunting structure,
but it is really just three Perl statements strung together.

Guttman-Rosler Transforms

Perl's regular sorting is very fast. It's optimized. So it'd be nice to
be able to use it whenever possible. That is the foundation of the
Guttman-Rosler Transform, called the GRT, for short.

The frame of a GRT is:

  @sorted =
    map { restore($_) }
    sort
    map { normalize($_) }
    @original;



An interesting application of the GRT is to sort strings in a
case-insensitive manner. First, we have to find the longest run of NULs
in all the strings (for a reason you'll soon see).

  my $nulls = 0;

  # find length of longest run of NULs
  for (@original) {
    for (/(\0+)/g) {
      $nulls = length($1) if length($1) > $nulls;
    }
  }



  $NUL = "\0" x ++$nulls;



Now, we have a string of nulls, whose length is one greater than the
largest run of nulls in the strings. This will allow us to safely
separate the lower-case version of the strings from the original
strings:

  # "\L...\E" is like lc(...)
  @normalized = map { "\L$_\E$NUL$_" } @original;



Now, we can just send this to sort.

  @sorted = sort @normalized;



And then to get back the data we had before, we split on the nulls:

  @sorted = map { (split /$NUL/)[1] } @original;



Putting it all together, we have:

  # implement our for loop from above
  # as a function
  $NUL = get_nulls(\@original);

  @sorted =
    map { (split /$NUL/)[1] }
    sort
    map { "\L$_\E$NUL$_" }
    @original;



The reason we use the NUL character is because it has an ASCII value of
0, so it's always less than or equal to any other character. Another
way to approach this is to pad the string with nulls so they all become
the same length:

  # see Exercise 1 for this function
  $maxlen = maxlen(\@original);



  @sorted =
    map { substr($_, $maxlen) }
    sort
    map { lc($_) . ("\0" x ($maxlen - length)) . $_ }
    @original;



Common functions used in a GRT are pack(), unpack(), and substr(). The
goal of a GRT is to make your data presentable as a string that will
work in a regular comparison.

Exercises
Write the maxlen() function for the previous chunk of code.

Portability

You can make a function to be used by sort() to avoid writing
potentially messy sorting code inline. For example, our Schwartzian
Transform:

  @sorted =
    {
    $a->[3] cmp $b->[3]
    or
    $a->[4] cmp $b->[4]
    or
    $a->[1] cmp $b->[1]
  }



However, if you want to declare that function in one package, and use
it in another, you run into problems.

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w



  package Sorting;



  sub passwd_cmp {
    $a->[3] cmp $b->[3]
    or
    $a->[4] cmp $b->[4]
    or
    $a->[1] cmp $b->[1]
  }



  sub case_insensitive_cmp {
    lc($a) cmp lc($b)
  }



  package main;



  @strings = sort Sorting::case_insensitive_cmp
    qw( this Mine yours Those THESE nevER );



  print "<@strings>\n";



  __END__
  <this Mine yours Those THESE nevER>



This code doesn't change the order of the strings. The reason is
because $a and $b in the sorting subroutine belong to Sorting::, but
the $a and $b that sort() is making belong to main::.

To get around this, you can give the function a prototype, and then it
will be passed the two arguments.

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w



  package Sorting;



  sub passwd_cmp ($$) {
    local ($a, $b) = @_;
    $a->[3] cmp $b->[3]
    or
    $a->[4] cmp $b->[4]
    or
    $a->[1] cmp $b->[1]
  }



  sub case_insensitive_cmp ($$) {
    local ($a, $b) = @_;
    lc($a) cmp lc($b)
  }



  package main;



  @strings = sort Sorting::case_insensitive_cmp
    qw( this Mine yours Those THESE nevER );



  print "<@strings>\n";



  __END__
  <Mine nevER THESE this Those yours>

-[0x07] # Wait: PHP SUCKS ------------------------------------------------

Time for the enlightenment. The "PHP sucks and we're telling you why"
orgy. This is the Perl Underground in everybody.

<revdiablo>	The earth turns, the grass grows, PHP sucks.

First of all, what are you going to do with namespaces? PHP still does
not have namespaces.

Then, what will you do with closures? PHP has no closures. Heck, it
doesn't even have anonymous functions. That's another thing: how will
you be rewriting that hash of coderefs? A hash of strings that are
evaled at runtime?

And what about all those objects that aren't simple hashes?

But let's assume you didn't use any of these slightly more advanced
programming techniques than the average PHP "programmer" can handle.
But you did use modules. You do use modules, don't you?

PHP is a web programming language, so it must have a good HTML parser
ready, right? One is available, but it cannot be called good. It cannot
even parse processing instructions like, ehm, <?php ...?> itself.

Another common task in web programming is sending HTML mail with a few
inline images. So what alternative for MIME::Lite do you have? The
PHP-ish solution is to build the message manually. Good luck, and have
fun.

But at least it can open files over HTTP. Yes, that it can. But what do
you do if you want more than that? What if you want to provide POST
content, headers, or implement ETags? Then, you must use Curl, which
isn't nearly as convenient as LWP. Don't even think about having
something like WWW::Mechanize in PHP.

Enough with the modules. I think I've proven my point that CPAN makes
Perl strong. Now let's discuss the core. In fact, let's focus on
something extremely elementary in programming: arrays!

PHP's "arrays" are hashes. It does not have arrays in the sense that
most languages have them. You can't just translate $foo[4] = 4; $foo[2]
= 2; foreach $element (@foo) { print $element } to $foo[4] = 4; $foo[2]
= 2; foreach ($foo as $element) { print $element }. The Perl version
prints 24, PHP insists on 42. Yes, there is ksort(), but that isn't
something you can guess. It requires very in-depth knowledge of PHP.
And that's the one thing PHP's documentation tries to avoid :)

Also, don't think $foo = bar() || $baz does the same in PHP. In PHP,
you end up with true or false. So you must write it in two separate
expressions.

Exactly what makes you think and even say moving from Perl to PHP is
easy? It's very, very hard to un-learn concise programming and go back
to medieval programming times. And converting existing code is even
harder.

<Brend> (Also, PHP sucks)

Arguments and return values are extremely inconsistent

To show this problem, here's a nice table of the functions that match a
user defined thing: (with something inconsistent like this, it's
amazing to find that the PHP documentation doesn't have such a table.
Maybe even PHP people will use this document, just to find out what
function to use :P)

The problem exists for other function groups too, not just for
matching.

(In Perl, all the functionality provided by the functions in this table
is available through a simple set of 4 operators.)

<linuxnohow>	dude, PHP sucks. plain and simple.

PHP has no lexical scope

Perl has lexical scope and dynamic scope. PHP doesn't have these.

For an explanation of why lexical scope is important, see Coping with
Scoping.

		       PHP  Perl
Superglobal	       Yes  Yes
Global		       Yes  Yes
Function local	       Yes  Yes
Lexical (block local)  No   Yes
Dynamic 	       No   Yes

<japhy> PHP sucks again.

PHP has too many functions in the main namespace

(Using the core binaries compiled with all possible extensions in the
core distribution, using recent versions in November 2003.)

Number of PHP  main functions: 3079
Number of Perl main functions:	206

Median PHP  function name length: 13
Mean   PHP  function name length: 13.67
Median Perl function name length:  6
Mean   Perl function name length:  6.22

Note that Perl has short syntax equivalents for some functions:

readpipe('ls -l') ==> `ls -l`
glob('*.txt')	  ==> <*.txt>
readline($fh)	  ==> <$fh>
quotemeta($foo)   ==> "\Q$foo"
lcfirst($foo)	  ==> "\l$foo"	(lc is \L)
ucfirst($foo)	  ==> "\u$foo"	(uc is \U)

<sili>	i'm there to slip in snide comments about how php sucks

No real references or pointers
No idea of namespace
No componentization
Wants to be Perl, but doesn't want to be Perl
No standard DB interface
All PHP community sites are for non-programmers
No chained method calls (Not true anymore --tnx.nl)
No globals except by importation
Both register_globals and $_REQUEST bite
Arrays are hashes
PEAR just ain't CPAN
Arrays cannot be interpolated into strings
No "use strict" like checking of variable names

<Juerd> php sucks

Perl is faster than PHP
Perl is more versatile than PHP
Perl has better documentation than PHP
PHP lacks support for modules
PHP's here-docs are useless for Windows users
PHP lacks a consistent database API
PHP dangerously caches database query results
For graphics, PHP is practically limited to GD

<rindolf>	I think PHP is the language and has applications with
the worst security track on the planet.
<rindolf>	Perl code can also be very insecure, but it's harder,
and also most PHP programmers are much more clueless than most Perl
programmers.

Comparing PHP to CGI/Perl is pointless. Compare PHP to either
Apache::EmbPerl or HTML::Mason, and you are starting to get a fair
comparison.

Having watched PHP develop over the years, it started out as a very
simple Perl replacement, but then has been slowly adding features of
Perl one by one, but three to five years later. In another five years,
it'll probably be where Perl is now.

So why wait? With Perl, you get a mature language, and a language that
works as well off the web as on. And HTML::Mason and everything else in
the CPAN make leveraging other people's implementation a snap for
nearly any common task.

PHP - it's "training wheels without the bike".

<pH> Of course you can write complex scripts in PHP - it's Turing
complete. It's just painful.

-[0x08] # School You: MJD ------------------------------------------------

Just the FAQs: Precedence Problems
What is Precedence?

What's 2+3√.4?

You probably learned about this in grade school; it was fourth-grade
material in the New York City public school I attended. If not, that's
okay too; I'll explain everything.

It's well-known that 2+3√.4 is 14, because you are supposed to do the
multiplication before the addition. 3√.4 is 12, and then you add the 2
and get 14. What you do not do is perform the operations in
left-to-right order; if you did that you would add 2 and 3 to get 5,
then multiply by 4 and get 20.

This is just a convention about what an expression like 2+3√.4 means.
It's not an important mathematical fact; it's just a rule we set down
about how to interpret certain ambiguous arithmetic expressions. It
could have gone the other way, or we could have the rule that the
operations are always done left-to-right. But we don't have those
rules; we have the rule that says that you do the multiplication first
and then the addition. We say that multiplication takes precedence over
addition.

What if you really do want to say `add 2 and 3, and multiply the result
by 4'? Then you use parentheses, like this: (2+3)√.4. The rule about
parentheses is that expressions in parentheses must always be fully
evaluated before anything else.

If we always used the parentheses, we wouldn't need rules about
precedence. There wouldn't be any ambiguous expressions. We have
precedence rules because we're lazy and we like to leave out the
parentheses when we can. The fully-parenthesized form is always
unambiguous. The precedence rule tells us how to interpret a version
with fewer parentheses to decide what it would look like if we wrote
the equivalent fully-parenthesized version. In the example above:

2+(3√.4)
(2+3)√.4

Is 2+3√.4 like (a) or like (b)?

The precedence rule just tells us that it is like (a), not like (b).

Rules and More Rules

In grade school you probably learned a few more rules:


	4 √. 52

Is this the same as


	(4 x 5)2  = 400
or	 4 x (52) = 100

? The rule is that exponentiation takes precedence over multiplication,
so it's the 100, and not 400.

What about 8 - 3 + 4? Is this like (8 - 3) + 4 = 9 or 8 - (3 + 4) = 1?
Here the rule is a little different. Neither + nor - has precedence
over the other. Instead, the - and + are just done left-to-right. This
rule handles the case of 8 - 4 - 3 also. Is it (8 - 4) - 3 = 1 or is it
8 - (4 - 3) = 7? Subtractions are done left-to-right, so it's 1 and not
7. A similar left-to-right rule handles ties between * and /.

Our rules are getting complicated now:

. Exponentiation first
. Then multiplication and division, left to right
. Then addition and subtraction, left to right

Maybe we can leave out the `left-to-right' part and just say that all
ties will be broken left-to right? No, because for exponentiation that
isn't true.

223

means 2(23) = 256, not (22)3 = 64.

So exponentiations are resolved from upper-right to lower-left. Perl
uses the token ** to represent exponentiation, writing x**y instead of
xy . In this case x**y**z means x**(y**z), not (x**y)**z, so ** is
resolved right-to-left.

Programming languages have this same notational problem, except that
they have it even worse than mathematics does, partly because they have
so many different operator symbols. For example, Perl has at least
seventy different operator symbols. This is a problem, because
communication with the compiler and with other programmers must be
unambiguous. You don't want to be writing something like 2+3√.4 and
have Perl compute 20 when you wanted 14, or vice versa.

Nobody knows a really good solution to this problem, and different
languages solve it in different ways. For example, the language APL,
which has a whole lot of unfamiliar operators like  and , dispenses
with precedence entirely and resolves them all from right to left. The
advantage of this is that you don't have to remember any rules, and the
disadvantage is that many expressions are confusing: If you write
2*3+4, you get 14, not 10. In Lisp the issue never comes up, because in
Lisp the parentheses are required, and so there are no ambiguous
expressions. (Now you know why Lisp looks the way it does.)

Perl, with its seventy operators, has to solve this problem somehow.
The strategy Perl takes (and most other programming languages as well)
is to take the fourth-grade system and extend it to deal with the new
operators. The operators are divided into many `precedence levels', and
certain operations, like multiplication, have higher precedence than
other operations, like addition. The levels are essentially arbitrary,
and are chosen without any deep plan, but with the hope that you will
be able to omit most of the parentheses most of the time and still get
what you want. So, for example, Perl gives * a higher precedence than
+, and ** a higher precedence than *, just like in grade school.

An Explosion of Rules

Let's see some examples of the reasons for which the precedence levels
are set the way they are. Suppose you wrote something like this:


	$v = $x + 3;

This is actually ambiguous. It might mean


	($v = $x) + 3;

or it might mean


	$v = ($x + 3);

The first of these is silly, because it stores the value $x into $v,
and then computes the value of $x+3 and then throws the result of the
addition away. In this case the addition was useless. The second one,
however, makes sense, because it does the addition first and stores the
result into $v. Since people write things like


	$v = $x + 3;

all the time, and expect to get the second behavior and not the first,
Perl's = operator has low precedence, lower than the precedence of +,
so that Perl makes the second interpretation.

Here's another example:


	$result = $x =~ /foo/;

means this:


	$result = ($x =~ /foo/);

which looks to see if $x contains the string foo, and stores a true or
false result into $result. It doesn't mean this:


	($result = $x) =~ /foo/;

which copies the value of $x into $result and then looks to see if
$result contains the string foo. In this case it's likely that the
programmer wanted the first meaning, not the second. But sometimes you
do want it to go the other way. Consider this expression:


	$p = $q =~ s/w//g;

Again, this expression is interpreted this way:


	$p = ($q =~ s/w//g);

All the w's are removed from $q, and the number of successful
substitutions is stored into $p. However, sometimes you really do want
the other meaning:


	($p = $q) =~ s/w//g;

This copies the value of $q into $p, and then removes all the w's from
$p, leaving $q alone. If you want this, you have to include the
parentheses explicitly, because = has lower precedence than =~.

Often the rules do what you want. Consider this:


	$worked = 1 + $s =~ /pattern/;

There are five ways to interpret this:

($worked = 1) + ($s =~ /pattern/);
(($worked = 1) + $s) =~ /pattern/;
($worked = (1 + $s)) =~ /pattern/;
$worked = ((1 + $s) =~ /pattern/);
$worked = (1 + ($s =~ /pattern/));

We already know that + has higher precedence than =, so it happens
before =, and that rules out (a) and (b).

We also know that =~ has higher precedence than =, so that rules out
(c).

To choose between (d) and (e) we need to know whether + takes
precedence over =~ or vice versa. (d) will convert $s to a number, add
1 to it, convert the resulting number to a string, and do the pattern
match. That is a pretty silly thing to do. (e) will match $s against
the pattern, return a boolean result, add 1 to that result to yield the
number 1 or 2, and store the number into $worked. That makes a lot more
sense; perhaps $worked will be used later to index an array. We should
hope that Perl chooses interpretation (e) rather than (d). And in fact
that is what it does, because =~ has higher precedence than +. =~
behaves similarly with respect to multiplication.

Our table of precedence is shaping up:


	1. **		(right to left)
	2. =~
	3. *, / 	(left to right)
	4. +, - 	(left to right)
	5. =

How are multiple = resolved? Left to right, or right to left? The
question is whether this:


	$a = $b = $c;

will mean this:


	($a = $b) = $c;

or this:


	$a = ($b = $c);

The first one means to store the value of $b into $a, and then to store
the value of $c into $a; this is obviously not useful. But the second
one means to store the value of $c into $b, and then to store that
value into $a also, and that obviously is useful. So = is resolved
right to left.

Why does =~ have lower precedence than **? No good reason. It's just a
side effect of the low precedence of =~ and the high precedence of **.
It's probably very rare to have =~ and ** in the same expression
anyway. Perl tries to get the common cases right. Here's another common
case:


	if ($x == 3 && $y == 4) { ... }

Is this interpreted as:

(($x == 3) && $y) == 4
($x == 3) && ($y == 4)
($x == ( 3 && $y)) == 4
$x == ((3 && $y) == 4)
$x == ( 3 && ($y == 4))

We really hope that it will be (b). To make (b) come out, && will have
to have lower precedence than ==; if the precedence is higher we'll get
(c) or (d), which would be awful. So && has lower precedence than ==.
If this seems like an obvious decision, consider that Pascal got it
wrong.

|| has precedence about the same as &&, but slightly lower, in
accordance with the usual convention of mathematicians, and by analogy
with * and +. ! has high precedence, because when people write


	!$x .....some long complicated expression....

they almost always mean that the ! applies to the $x, not to the entire
long complicated expression. In fact, almost the only time they don't
mean this is in cases like this one:


	if (! $x->{'annoying'}) { ... }

it would be very annoying if this were interpreted to mean


	if ((! $x)->{'annoying'}) { ... }

The same argument we used to explain why ! has high precedence works
even better and explains why -> has even higher precedence. In fact, ->
has the highest precedence of all. If ## and @@ are any two operators
at all, then


	$a ## $x->$y
and

	$x->$y @@ $b

always mean


	$a ## ($x->$y)
and

	($x->$y) @@ $b

and not


	($a ## $x)->$y
or

	$x->($y @@ $b)

For a long time, the operator with lowest precedence was the ,
operator. The , operator is for evaluating two expressions in sequence.
For example


	$a*=2 , $c*=3

doubles $a and triples $c. It would be a shame if you wrote something
like this:


	$a*=2 , $c*=3 if $change_the_variables;

and Perl interpreted it to mean this:


	$a*= (2, $c) *= 3 if $change_the_variables;

That would just be bizarre. The very very low precedence of , ensures
that you can write


	EXPR1, EXPR2

for any two expressions at all, and be sure that they are not going to
get mashed together to make some nonsense expression like $a*= (2, $c)
*= 3.

, is also the list constructor operator. If you want to make a list of
three things, you have to write


	@list = ('Gold', 'Frankincense', 'Myrrh');

because if you left off the parentheses, like this:


	@list = 'Gold', 'Frankincense', 'Myrrh';

what you would get would be the same as this:


	(@list = 'Gold'), 'Frankincense', 'Myrrh';

This assigns @list to have one element (Gold) and then executes the two
following expressions in sequence, which is pointless. So this is a
prime example of a case where the default precedence rules don't do
what you want. But people are already in the habit of putting
parentheses around their list elements, so nobody minds this very much,
and the problem isn't really a problem at all.

Precedence Traps and Surprises

This very low precedence for , causes some other problems, however.
Consider this common idiom:


	open(F, "< $file") || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";

This tries to open a filehandle, and if it can't it aborts the program
with an error message. Now watch what happens if you leave the
parentheses off the open call:


	open F, "< $file"  || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";

, has very low precedence, so the || takes precedence here, and Perl
interprets this expression as if you had written this:


	open F, ("< $file"  || die "Couldn't open $file: $!");

This is totally bizarre, because the die will only be executed when the
string "< $file" is false, which never happens. Since the die is
controlled by the string and not by the open call, the program will not
abort on errors the way you wanted. Here we wish that || had lower
precedence, so that we could write


	try to perform big long hairy complicated action     || die ;

and be sure that the || was not going to gobble up part of the action
the way it did in our open example. Perl 5 introduced a new version of
|| that has low precedence, for exactly this purpose. It's spelled or,
and in fact it has the lowest precedence of all Perl's operators. You
can write


	try to perform big long hairy complicated action     or die ;

and be quite sure that or will not gobble up part of the action the way
it did in our open example, whether or not you leave off the
parentheses. To summarize:


	open(F, "< $file") or die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  # OK
	open F, "< $file"  or die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  # OK
	open(F, "< $file") || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  # OK
	open F, "< $file"  || die "Couldn't open $file: $!";  #
Whooops!

If you use or, you're safe from this error, and if you always put in
the parentheses, you're safe. Pick a strategy you like and stick with
it.

The other big use of || is to select a value from the first source that
provides it. For example:


	$directory = $opt_D || $ENV{DIRECTORY} || $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY;

It looks to see if there was a -D command-line option specifying the
directory first; if not, it looks to see if the user set the DIRECTORY
environment variable; if neither of these is set, it uses a hard-wired
default directory. It gets the first value that it can, so, for
example, if you have the environment variable set and supply an
explicit -D option when you run the program, the option overrides the
environment variable. The precedence of || is higher than that of =, so
this means what we wanted:


	$directory = ($opt_D || $ENV{DIRECTORY} || $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY);

But sometimes people have a little knowledge and end up sabotaging
themselves, and they write this:


	$directory = $opt_D or $ENV{DIRECTORY} or $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY;

or has very very very low precedence, even lower than =, so Perl
interprets this as:


	($directory = $opt_D) or $ENV{DIRECTORY} or $DEFAULT_DIRECTORY;

$directory is always assigned from the command-line option, even if
none was set. Then the values of the expressions $ENV{DIRECTORY} and
$DEFAULT_DIRECTORY are thrown away. Perl's -w option will warn you
about this mistake if you make it. To avoid it, remember this rule of
thumb: use || for selecting values, and use or for controlling the flow
of statements.

List Operators and Unary Operators

A related problem is that all of Perl's `list operators' have high
precedence, and tend to gobble up everything to their right. (A `list
operator' is a Perl function that accepts a list of arguments, like
open as above, or print.) We already saw this problem with open. Here's
a similar sort of problem:


	@successes = (unlink $new, symlink $old, $new, open N, $new);

This isn't even clear to humans. What was really meant was


	@successes = (unlink($new), symlink($old, $new), open(N,
$new));

which performs the three operations in sequence and stores the three
success-or-failure codes into @successes. But what Perl thought we
meant here was something totally different:


	@successes = (unlink($new, symlink($old, $new, open(N,
$new))));

It thinks that the result of the open call should be used as the third
argument to symlink, and that the result of symlink should be passed to
unlink, which will try to remove a file with that name. This won't even
compile, because symlink needs two arguments, not three. We saw one way
to dismbiguate this; another is to write it like this:


	@successes = ((unlink $new), (symlink $old, $new), (open N,
$new));

Again, pick a style you like and stick with it.

Why do Perl list operators gobble up everything to the right? Often
it's very handy. For example:


	@textfiles = grep -T, map "$DIRNAME/$_", readdir DIR;

Here Perl behaves as if you had written this:


	@textfiles = grep(-T, (map("$DIRNAME/$_", (readdir(DIR)))));

Some filenames are read from the dirhandle with readdir and the
resulting list is passed to map, which turns each filename into a full
path name and returns a list of paths. Then grep filters the list of
paths, extracts all the paths that refer to text files, and returns a
list of just the text files from the directory.

One possibly fine point is that the parentheses might not always mean
what you want. For example, suppose you had this:


	print $a, $b, $c;

Then you discover that you need to print out double the value of $a. If
you do this you're safe:


	print 2*$a, $b, $c;

but if you do this, you might get a surprise:


	print (2*$a), $b, $c;

If a list operator is followed by parentheses, Perl assumes that the
parentheses enclose all the arguments, so it interprets this as:


	(print (2*$a)), $b, $c;

It prints out twice $a, but doesn't print out $b or $c at all. (Perl
will warn you about this if you have -w on.) To fix this, add more
parentheses:


	print ((2*$a), $b, $c);

Some people will suggest that you do this instead:


	print +(2*$a), $b, $c;

Perl does what you want here, but I think it's bad advice because it
looks bizarre.

Here's a similar example:


	print @items, @more_items;

Say we want to join up the @items with some separator, so we use join:


	print join '---', @items, @more_items;

Oops; this is wrong; we only want to join @items, not @more_items also.
One way we might try to fix this is:


	print (join '---', @items), @more_items;

This falls afoul of the problem we just saw: Perl sees the parentheses,
assumes that they contain the arguments of print, and never prints
@more_items at all. To fix, use


	print ((join '---', @items), @more_items);
or
	print join('---', @items), @more_items;

Sometimes you won't have this problem. Some of Perl's built-in
functions are unary operators, which means that they always get exactly
one argument. defined and uc are examples. They don't have the problem
that the list operators have of gobbling everything to the right; the
only gobble one argument. Here's an example similar to the one I just
showed:


	print $a, $b;

Now we decide we want to print $a in all lower case letters:


	print lc $a, $b;

Don't we have the same problem as in the print join example? If we did,
it would print $b in all lower case also. But it doesn't, because lc is
a unary operator and only gets one argument. This doesn't need any
fixing.

	   right       not

This is straight out of the perlop manual page that comes with Perl.
left and right mean that the operators associate to the left or the
right, respectively; nonassoc means that the operators don't associate
at all. For example, if you try to write


	$a < $b < $c

Perl will deliver a syntax error message. Perhaps what you really meant
was


	$a < $b && $b < $c

The precedence table is much too big and complicated to remember;
that's a problem with Perl's approach. You have to trust it to handle
to common cases correctly, and be prepared to deal with bizarre,
hard-to-find bugs when it doesn't do what you wanted. The alternatives,
as I mentioned before, have their own disadvantages.

How to Remember all the Rules

Probably the best strategy for dealing with Perl's complicated
precedence hierarchy is to cluster the operators in your mind:


	Arithmetic:	+, -, *, /, %, **


	Bitwise:	&, |, ~, <<, >>


	Logical:	&&, ||, !


	Comparison:	==, !=, >=, <=, >, <


	Assignment:	=, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.

and try to remember how the operators behave within each group. Mostly
the answer will be `they behave as you expect'. For example, the
operators in the `arithmetic' group all behave the according to the
rules you learned in fourth grade. The `comparison' group all have
about the same precedence, and you aren't allowed to mix them anyway,
except to say something like


	$a<$b == $c<$d

which compares the truth values of $a<$b and $c<$d.

Then, once you're familiar with the rather unsurprising behavior of the
most common groups, just use parentheses liberally everywhere else.

=head1 NAME

Number::Fraction - Perl extension to model fractions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Number::Fraction;

  my $f1 = Number::Fraction->new(1, 2);
  my $f2 = Number::Fraction->new('1/2');
  my $f3 = Number::Fraction->new($f1); # clone
  my $f4 = Number::Fraction->new; # 0/1

or

  use Number::Fraction ':constants'

  my $f1 = '1/2';

  my $one = $f1 + $f2;
  my $half = $one - $f1;
  print $half; # prints '1/2'

=head1 ABSTRACT

Number::Fraction is a Perl module which allows you to work with fractions
in your Perl programs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Number::Fraction allows you to work with fractions (i.e. rational
numbers) in your Perl programs in a very natural way.

It was originally written as a demonstration of the techniques of 
overloading.

If you use the module in your program in the usual way

  use Number::Fraction;

you can then create fraction objects using C<Number::Fraction->new> in
a number of ways.

  my $f1 = Number::Fraction->new(1, 2);

creates a fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 2.

  my $f2 = Number::Fraction->new('1/2');

does the same thing but from a string constant.

  my $f3 = Number::Fraction->new($f1);

makes C<$f3> a copy of C<$f1>

  my $f4 = Number::Fraction->new; # 0/1

creates a fraction with a denominator of 0 and a numerator of 1.

If you use the alterative syntax of

  use Number::Fraction ':constants';

then Number::Fraction will automatically create fraction objects from
string constants in your program. Any time your program contains a 
string constant of the form C<\d+/\d+> then that will be automatically
replaced with the equivalent fraction object. For example

  my $f1 = '1/2';

Having created fraction objects you can manipulate them using most of the
normal mathematical operations.

  my $one = $f1 + $f2;
  my $half = $one - $f1;

Additionally, whenever a fraction object is evaluated in a string
context, it will return a string in the format x/y. When a fraction
object is evaluated in a numerical context, it will return a floating
point representation of its value.

Fraction objects will always "normalise" themselves. That is, if you
create a fraction of '2/4', it will silently be converted to '1/2'.

Called when module is C<use>d. Use to optionally install constant
handler.

Be a good citizen and uninstall constant handler when caller uses
C<no Number::Fraction>.

sub unimport {
  overload::remove_constant(q => undef);
}

=head2 new

Constructor for Number::Fraction object. Takes the following kinds of
parameters:

=over 4

=item *

A single Number::Fraction object which is cloned.

=item *

A string in the form 'x/y' where x and y are integers. x is used as the
numerator and y is used as the denominator of the new object.

=item *

Two integers which are used as the numerator and denominator of the
new object.

=item *

A single integer which is used as the numerator of the the new object.
The denominator is set to 1.

=item *

No arguments, in which case a numerator of 0 and a denominator of 1
are used.

=back

Returns C<undef> if a Number::Fraction object can't be created.

The purpose of this tutorial is to give a general overview of what
iterators are, why they are useful, how to build them, and things to
consider to avoid common pitfalls. I intend to give the reader enough
information to begin using iterators, though this article assumes some
understanding of idiomatic Perl programming. Please consult the "See
Also" section if you need supplemental information.
What Is an Iterator?

Iterators come in many forms, and you have probably used one without
even knowing it. The readline and glob functions, as well as the
flip-flop operator, are all iterators when used in scalar context. A
user-defined iterator usually takes the form of a code reference that,
when executed, calculates the next item in a list and returns it. When
the iterator reaches the end of the list, it returns an agreed-upon
value. While implementations vary, a subroutine that creates a closure
around any necessary state variables and returns the code reference is
common. This technique is called a factory and facilitates code reuse.
Why Are Iterators Useful?

The most straightforward way to use a list is to define an algorithm to
generate the list and store the results in an array. There are several
reasons why you might want to consider an iterator instead:

Code Fragments only

The list in its entirety would use too much memory.

Iterators have tiny memory footprints, because they can store only the
state information necessary to calculate the next item.

The list is infinite.

Iterators return after each iteration, allowing the traversal of an
infinite list to stop at any point.

The list should be circular.

Iterators contain state information, as well as logic allowing a list
to wrap around.

The list is large but you only need a few items.

Iterators allow you to stop at any time, avoiding the need to calculate
any more items than is necessary.
The list needs to be duplicated, split, or variated.

Iterators are lightweight and have their own copies of state variables.
How to Build an Iterator

The basic structure of an iterator factory looks like this:

sub gen_iterator {
    my @initial_info = @_;

    my ($current_state, $done);

    return sub {
	# code to calculate $next_state or $done;
	return undef if $done;
	return $current_state = $next_state;
    };
}

To make the factory more flexible, the factory may take arguments to
decide how to create the iterator. The factory declares all necessary
state variables and possibly initializes them. It then returns a code
reference--in the same scope as the state variables--to the caller,
completing the transaction. Upon each execution of the code reference,
the state variables are updated and the next item is returned, until
the iterator has exhausted the list.

The basic usage of an iterator looks like this:

my $next = gen_iterator( 42 );
while ( my $item = $next->() ) {
    print "$item\n";
}
Example: The List in Its Entirety Would Use Too Much Memory

You work in genetics and you need every possible sequence of DNA
strands of lengths 1 to 14. Even if there were no memory overhead in
using arrays, it would still take nearly five gigabytes of memory to
accommodate the full list. Iterators come to the rescue:

my @DNA = qw/A C T G/;
my $seq = gen_permutate(14, @DNA);
while ( my $strand = $seq->() ) {
    print "$strand\n";
}

sub gen_permutate {
    my ($max, @list) = @_;
    my @curr;
    return sub {
	if ( (join '', map { $list[ $_ ] } @curr) eq $list[ -1 ] x
@curr ) {
	    @curr = (0) x (@curr + 1);
	}
	else {
	    my $pos = @curr;
	    while ( --$pos > -1 ) {
		++$curr[ $pos ], last if $curr[ $pos ] < $#list;
		$curr[ $pos ] = 0;
	    }
	}
	return undef if @curr > $max;
	return join '', map { $list[ $_ ] } @curr;
    };
}
Example: The List Is Infinite

You need to assign IDs to all current and future employees and ensure
that it is possible to determine if an ID is valid with nothing more
than the number itself. You have already taken care of persistence and
number validation (using the LUHN formula). Iterators take care of the
rest:

my $start = $ARGV[0] || 999999;
my $next_id = gen_id( $start );
print $next_id->(), "\n" for 1 .. 10;  # Next 10 IDs

sub gen_id {
    my $curr = shift;
    return sub {
	0 while ! is_valid( ++$curr );
	return $curr;
    };
}

sub is_valid {
    my ($num, $chk) = (shift, '');
    my $tot;
    for ( 0 .. length($num) - 1 ) {
	my $dig = substr($num, $_, 1);
	$_ % 2 ? ($chk .= $dig * 2) : ($tot += $dig);
    }

    $tot += $_ for split //, $chk;

    return $tot % 10 == 0 ? 1 : 0;
}
Example: The List Should Be Circular

You need to support legacy apps with hardcoded filenames, but want to
keep logs for three days before overwriting them. You have everything
you need except a way to keep track of which file to write to:

my $next_file = rotate( qw/FileA FileB FileC/ );
print $next_file->(), "\n" for 1 .. 10;

sub rotate {
    my @list  = @_;
    my $index = -1;

    return sub {
	$index++;
	$index = 0 if $index > $#list;
	return $list[ $index ];
    };
}

Adding one state variable and an additional check would provide the
ability to loop a user-defined number of times.
Example: The List Is Large But Only a Few Items May Be Needed

You have forgotten the password to your DSL modem and the vendor
charges more than the cost of a replacement to unlock it. Fortunately,
you remember that it was only four lowercase characters:

while ( my $pass = $next_pw->() ) {
    if ( unlock( $pass ) ) {
	print "$pass\n";
	last;
    }
}

sub fix_size_perm {

    my ($size, @list) = @_;
    my @curr	      = (0) x ($size - 1);

    push @curr, -1;

    return sub {
	if ( (join '', map { $list[ $_ ] } @curr) eq $list[ -1 ] x
@curr ) {
	    @curr = (0) x (@curr + 1);
	}
	else {
	    my $pos = @curr;
	    while ( --$pos > -1 ) {
		++$curr[ $pos ], last if $curr[ $pos ] < $#list;
		$curr[ $pos ] = 0;
	    }
	}

	return undef if @curr > $size;
	return join '', map { $list[ $_ ] } @curr;
    };
}

sub unlock { $_[0] eq 'john' }
Example: The List Needs To Be Duplicated, Split, or Modified into
Multiple Variants

Duplicating the list is useful when each item of the list requires
multiple functions applied to it, if you can apply them in parallel. If
there is only one function, it may be advantageous to break the list up
and run duplicate copies of the function. In some cases, multiple
variations are necessary, which is why factories are so useful. For
instance, multiple lists of different letters might come in handy when
writing a crossword solver.

The following example uses the idea of breaking up the list to enhance
the employee ID example. Assigning ranges to departments adds
additional meaning to the ID.

my %lookup;

@lookup{ qw/sales support security management/ }
    = map { { start => $_ * 10_000 } } 1..4;

$lookup{$_}{iter} = gen_id( $lookup{$_}{start} ) for keys %lookup;

# ....

my $dept = $employee->dept;
my $id	 = $lookup{$dept}{id}();
$employee->id( $id );
Things To Consider
The iterator's @_ is Different Than the Factory's

The following code doesn't work as you might expect:

sub gen_greeting {
    return sub { print "Hello ", $_[0] };
}

my $greeting = gen_greeting( 'world' );
$greeting->();

It may seem obvious, but closures need lexicals to close over, as each
subroutine has its own @_. The fix is simple:

sub gen_greeting {
    my $msg = shift;
    return sub { print "Hello ", $msg };
}
The Return Value Indicating Exhaustion Is Important

Attempt to identify a value that will never occur in the list. Using
undef is usually safe, but not always. Document your choice well, so
calling code can behave correctly. Using while ( my $answer = $next->()
) { ... } would result in an infinite loop if 42 indicated exhaustion.

If it is not possible to know in advance valid values in the list,
allow users to define their own values as an argument to the factory.
References to External Variables for State May Cause Problems

Problems can arise when factory arguments needed to maintain state are
references. This is because the variable being referred to can have its
value changed at any time during the course of iteration. A solution
might be to de-reference and make a copy of the result. In the case of
large hashes or arrays, this may be counterproductive to the ultimate
goal. Document your solution and your assumptions so that the caller
knows what to expect.
You May Need to Handle Edge Cases

Sometimes, the first or the last item in a list requires more logic
than the others in the list. Consider the following iterator for the
Fibonacci numbers:

sub gen_fib {
    my ($low, $high) = (1, 0);

    return sub {
	($low, $high) = ($high, $low + $high);
	return $high;
    };
}

my $fib = gen_fib();
print $fib->(), "\n" for 1 .. 20;

Besides the funny initialization of $low being greater than $high, it
also misses 0, which should be the first item returned. Here is one way
to handle it:

sub gen_fib {

    my ($low, $high) = (1, 0);

    my $seen_edge;

    return sub {
	return 0 if ! $seen_edge++;
	($low, $high) = ($high, $low + $high);
	return $high;
    };
}
State Variables Persist As Long As the Iterator

Reaching the end of the list does not necessarily free the iterator and
state variables. Because Perl uses reference counting for its garbage
collection, the state variables will exist as long as the iterator
does.

Though most iterators have a small memory footprint, this is not always
the case. Even if a single iterator doesn't consume a large amount of
memory, it isn't always possible to forsee how many iterators a program
will create. Be sure to document how the caller can destroy the
iterator when necessary.

In addition to documentation, you may also want to undef the state
variables at exhaustion, and perhaps warn the caller if the iterator is
being called after exhaustion.

sub gen_countdown {
   my $curr = shift;

   return sub {
       return $curr++ || 'blast off';
   }
}

my $t = gen_countdown( -10 );
print $t->(), "\n" for 1..12; # off by 1 error

Becomes:

sub gen_countdown {
   my $curr = shift;

   return sub {
       if ( defined $curr && $curr == 0 ) {
	   undef $curr, return 'blast off';
       }

       warn 'List already exhausted' and return if ! $curr;

       return $curr++;
   }
}

-[0x0F] # To envision a stack --------------------------------------------

Let's talk about stacks. Stacks are stacks. We use a LIFO (last in
first out) stack. For a moment, and just a moment, let's imagine that
Perl's arrays are stacks. You may well know the 'push' option to push
an item onto the 'top' of this stack. You should know of 'pop' to take
an item off the top of this stack. Historically, this is how we do it.
However, in Perl we can do the same to either end of the stack. We can
use 'shift' to shift an item out from the 'bottom' of the stack. Or use
'unshift' to add an object to the bottom of this stack. Conveniently,
those will work by default on @ARGV. Due to this, we can use code such
as 'my $call = shift;' instead of something like 'my $call = $ARGV[0]'.

Let's stop thinking of Perl arrays as stacks. They really aren't very
stack-like. I just use the example to try to get some form of
communication to your simple minds. If you want to put a physical image
to Perl arrays, think of them as a hollow cylinder lying on its side.
You can add or remove from either end. Unlike some other languages,
removing from the bottom of this array doesn't require that the other
values all be shifted down, they only appear shifted down. Perl arrays
grow both ways, there is no difference. Don't believe me? Whip out
Benchmark.pm and time the operations. That is, if you can figure out
how to use it.

Why am I explaining this? Here I am, questioning myself over this very
dull description of a very simple concept. Yet, it must be justified,
because so few of you actually understand and use it. Where is the
creativity? Why, when given some power, you shrink from it and fear it,
instead of reaching out and grasping hold of it? Anyways, to continue,
and get to the point

On second thought, FUCK IT, you are a waste of my fucking time.

Unix Review Column 63 (Mar 2006)

[suggested title: ``Inside-out Objects'']

In [my previous article], I created a traditional hash-based Perl
object: a Rectangle with two attributes (width and height) using the
constructor and accessors like so:

  package Rectangle;
  sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    my $self = {
      width => $args{width} || 0;
      height => $args{height} || 0;
    };
    return bless $self, $class;
  }
  sub width {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{width};
  }
  sub set_width {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{width} = shift;
  }
  sub height {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{height};
  }
  sub set_height {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{height} = shift;
  }

I can construct a 3-by-4 rectangle easily:

  my $r = Rectangle->new(width => 3, height => 4);

At this point, $r is an object of type Rectangle, but it's also simply
a hashref. For example, the code in set_width merely deferences a value
like $r to gain access to the hash element with a key of width. But
does Perl require such code to be located within the Rectangle package?
No. As a user of the Rectangle class, I could easily say:

  $r->{width} = 5;

and update the width from 3 to 5. This is ``peering inside the box'',
and will lead to fragile code, because we've now exposed the
implementation of the object, not just the interface.

For example, suppose we modify the set_width method to ensure that the
width is never negative:

  use Carp qw(croak);
  sub set_width {
    my $self = shift;
    my $width = shift;
    croak "$self: width cannot be negative: $width"
      if $width < 0;
    $self->{width} = $width;
  }

If the $width is less than 0, we croak, triggering a fatal exception,
but blaming the caller of this method. (We don't blame ourselves, and
croak is a great way to pass the blame.)

At this point, we'll trap erroneous settings:

  $r->set_width(-3); # will die

But if someone has broken the box open, we get no fault:

  $r->{width} = -3; # no death

This is bad, because the author of the Rectangle class no longer
controls behavior for the objects, because the data implementation has
been exposed.

Besides exposing the implementation, another problem is that I have to
be careful of typos. Suppose in rewriting the set_width method, I
accidentally transposed the last two letters of the hash key:

    $self->{widht} = $width;

This is perfectly legal Perl, and would not throw any compile-time or
run-time errors. Even use strict isn't helping here, because I'm not
misspelling a variable name: just naming a ``new'' hash key. Without
good unit tests and integration tests, I might not even catch this
error. Yes, there are some solutions to ensure that a hash's keys come
from only a particular set of permitted keys, but these generally slow
down the hash access significantly.

We can solve both of these problems at once, without significantly
impacting the performance of our programs by using what's come to be
known as an inside-out object. First popularized by Damian Conway in
the neoclassic Object-Oriented Perl book, an inside-out object creates
a series of parallel hashes for the attributes (much like we had to do
back in the Perl4 days before we had hashrefs). For example, instead of
creating a single object for a rectangle that is 3 by 4:

  my $r = { width => 3, height => 4 };

we can record its attributes in two separate hashes, keyed by some
unique string:

  my $r = "some unique string";
  $width{$r} = 3;
  $height{$r} = 4;

Now, to get the height of the rectangle, we use the unique string:

  my $width = $width{$r};

and to update the height, we use that same string:

  $height{$r} = 10;

When we turn on use strict, and declare the %width and %height
attribute hashes, this will trap any typos related to attribute names:

  use strict;
  my %width;
  my %height;
  ...
  my $r = "another unique string";
  $height{$r} = 7; # ok
  $widht{$r} = 3; # won't compile!

The typo on the width is now caught, because we don't have a %widht
hash. Hooray. That solves the second problem. But how do we solve the
first problem, and where do we get this ``unique string'', and how do
we get methods on our object?

If I assign a blessed anonymous empty hash to $r:

  my $r = bless {}, "Rectangle";

then when the value of $r is used as a string, I get a nice unique
string:

  Rectangle=HASH(0x400180FE)

where the number comes from the hex representation of the internal
memory address of the object. As long as this reference is alive, that
memory address will not be reused. Aha, there's our unique string:

  sub new_7_by_3 {
    my $self = bless {}, shift;
    $height{$self} = 7;
    $width{$self} = 3;
    return $self;
  }

And this is what our constructor does! By blessing the object, we'll
return to the same package for methods. By having an anonymous hashref,
we're guaranteed a unique number. And as long as the lexical %height
and %width hashes are in scope, we can access and update the
attributes.

But what are we returning? Sure, it's a hashref, but it's empty.
There's no code that we can use to get from $r to the attribute hashes:

  my $r = Rectangle->new_7_by_3;

The only way we can get the height is to have code in same scope as the
definitions of the attribute hashes:

  sub height {
    my $self = shift;
    return $height{$self};
  }

And then we can use that code in our main program:

  my $height = $r->height;

The first parameter is $r, which gets used only for its unique string
value, as a key into the lexical %height hash! It all Just Works.

Well, for some meaning of Works. We still have a couple of things to
fix. First, there's really no reason to make an anonymous hash, because
we never put anything into it, so we might as well make it a scalar:

  my $self = bless \(my $dummy), shift;

Because Perl doesn't have a primitive anonymous scalar constructor, I'm
cheating by making a $dummy variable.

Second, we've got some tidying up to do. When a value is no longer
being referenced by any variable, we say it goes out of scope. When a
traditional hashref based object goes out of scope, any elements of the
hash are also discarded, usually causing the values to also go out of
scope (unless they are also referenced by some other live value). This
all happens quite automatically and efficiently.

However, when our inside-out object goes out of scope, it doesn't
``contain'' anything. However, its address-as-a-string is being used in
one or more attribute hashes, and we need to get rid of those to mimic
the traditional object mechanism. So, we'll need to add a DESTROY
method:

  sub DESTROY {
    my $dead_body = $_[0];
    delete $height{$dead_body};
    delete $width{$dead_body};
    my $super = $dead_body->can("SUPER::DESTROY");
    goto &$super if $super;
  }

Note that after deleting our attributes, we also call any superclass
destructor, so that it has a chance to clean up too.

Let's put it all together:

  package Rectangle;
  my %width;

Not bad! Only slightly more complex than a traditional hashref
implementation, and a lot safer for the ``outside''. Of course, this is
a lot of code to get right, so the best thing is to let someone else do
the hard work. See Class::Std and Object::InsideOut for some budding
frameworks to build these objects. Until next time, enjoy!

This module exploits a vulnerability in Safari's "Safe file" feature, which will
automatically open any file with one of the allowed extensions. This can be abused
by supplying a zip file, containing a shell script, with a metafile indicating
that the file should be opened by Terminal.app. This module depends on
the 'zip' command-line utility.

-[0x12] # School You: broquaint ------------------------------------------

Welcome to Of Symbol Tables and Globs where you'll be taken on a
journey through the inner workings of those mysterious perlish
substances: globs and symbol tables. We'll start off in the land of
symbol tables where the globs live and in the second part of the
tutorial progress onto the glob creatures themselves.

Symbol tables

Perl has two different types of variables - lexical and package global.
In this particular tutorial we'll only be covering package global
variables as lexical variables have nothing to do with globs or symbol
tables (see. Lexical scoping like a fox for more information on lexical
variables).

Now a package global variable can only live within a symbol table and
is dynamically scoped (versus lexically scoped). These package global
variables live in symbol tables, or to be more accurate, they live in
slots within globs which themselves live in the symbol tables.

A symbol table comes about in various ways, but the most common way in
which they are created is through the package declaration. Every
variable, subroutine, filehandle and format declared within a package
will live in a glob slot within the given package's symbol table (this
is of course excluding any lexical declarations)

## create an anonymous block to limit the scope of the package
{
  package globtut;

  $var = "a string";
  @var	= qw( a list of strings );

  sub var { }
}

use Data::Dumper;

print Dumper(\%globtut::);

__output__

$VAR1 = {
	  'var' => *globtut::var
	};


There we create a symbol table with package globtut, then the scalar,
array and subroutine are all 'put' into the *var glob because they all
share the same name. This is implicit behavior for the vars, so if we
wanted to explicitly declare the vars into the globtut symbol table
we'd do the following

$globtut::var = "a string";
@globtut::var  = qw( a list of strings );

sub globtut::var { }

use Data::Dumper;

print Dumper(\%globtut::);

__output__

$VAR1 = {
	  'var' => *globtut::var
	};


Notice how we didn't use a package declaration there? This is because
the globtut symbol table is auto-vivified when $globtut::var is
declared.

Something else to note about the symbol table is that it has two colons
appended to the name, so globtut became %globtut::. This means that any
packages that live below that will have :: prepended to the name, so if
we add a child package it would be neatly separated by the double
colons e.g

use Data::Dumper;
{
  package globtut;
  package globtut::child;
  ##		 ^^
}


Another attribute of symbol tables demonstrated when %globtut:: was
dumped above is that they are accessed just like normal perl hashes. In
fact, they are like normal hashes in many respects, you can perform all
the normal hash operations on a symbol table and add normal key-value
pairs, and if you're brave enough to look under the hood you'll notice
that they are in fact hashes, but with a touch of that perl Magic. Here
are some examples of hash operations being used on symbol tables

use Data::Dumper;
{
  package globtut;

  $foo = "a string";

  $globtut::{bar} = "I'm not even a glob!";
  %globtut::baz:: = %globtut::;

  print Data::Dumper::Dumper(\%globtut::baz::);

  print "keys:	  ", join(', ', keys %globtut::),   $/;
  print "values:  ", join(', ', values %globtut::), $/;
  print "each:	  ", join(' => ', each %globtut::), $/;

  print "exists:  ", (exists $globtut::{foo}  && "exists"),  $/;
  print "delete:  ", (delete $globtut::{foo}  && "deleted"), $/;
  print "defined: ", (defined $globtut::{foo} || "no foo"),  $/;
}

__output__

$VAR1 = {
	  'foo' => *globtut::foo,
	  'bar' => 'I\'m not even a glob!',
	  'baz::' => *{'globtut::baz::'}
	};
keys:	 foo, bar, baz::
values:  *globtut::foo, I'm not even a glob!, *globtut::baz::
each:	 foo => *globtut::foo
exists:  exists
delete:  deleted
defined: no foo


So to access the globs within the globtut symbol table we access the
desired key which will correspond to a variable name

{
  package globtut;

  $variable = "a string";
  @variable  = qw( a list of strings );

  sub variable { }

  print $globtut::{variable}, "\n";
}

__output__

*globtut::variable


And if we want to add another glob to a symbol table we add it exactly
like we would with a hash

{
  package globtut;

  $foo = "a string";
  $globtut::{variable} = *foo;

  print "\$variable: $variable\n";
}

__output__

$variable: a string


If you'd like to see some more advanced uses of symbol tables and
symbol table manipulation then check out the Symbol module which comes
with the core perl distribution, and more specifically the
Symbol::gensym function.

Globs

So we can now see that globs live within symbol tables, but that
doesn't tell us a lot about globs themselves and so this section of the
tutorial shall endeavour to explain them.

Within a glob are 6 slots where the various perl data types will be
stored. The 6 slots which are available are

SCALAR - scalar variables
ARRAY - array variables
HASH - hash variables
CODE - subroutines
IO - directory/file handles
FORMAT - formats

All these slots are accessible bar the FORMAT slot. Why this is I don't
know, but I don't think it's of any great loss.

It may be asked as to why there isn't a GLOB type, and the answer would
be that globs are containers or meta-types (depending on how you want
to see it) not data types.

Accessing globs is similar to accessing hashes, accept we use the *
sigil and the only keys are those data types listed above


$scalar = "a simple string";
print *scalar{SCALAR}, "\n";

__output__

SCALAR(0x8107e78)


"$Exclamation", you say, "I was expecting 'a simple string', not a
reference!". This is because the slots within the globs only contain
references, and these references point to the values. So what we really
wanted to say was

$scalar = "a simple string";
print ${ *scalar{SCALAR} }, "\n";

__output__

a simple string


Which is essentially just a complex way of saying

  $scalar = "a simple string";
  print $::scalar, "\n";

  __output__

  a simple string


So as you can probably guess perl's sigils are the conventional method
of accessing the individual data types within globs. As for the likes
of IO it has to be accessed specifically as perl doesn't provide an
access sigil for it.

Something you may have noticed is that we're referencing the globs
directly, without going through the symbol table. This is because globs
are "global" and are not effected by strict. But if we wanted to access
the globs via the symbol table then we would do it like so

$scalar = "a simple string";
print ${ *{$main::{scalar}}{SCALAR} }, "\n";

__output__

a simple string


Now the devious among you may be thinking something along the lines of
"If it's a hash then why don't I just put any old value in there?". The
answer to this of course, is that you can't as globs aren't hashes! So
we can try, but we will fail like so

${ *scalar{FOO} } = "the FOO data type";

__output__

Can't use an undefined value as a SCALAR reference at - line 1.


So we can't force a new type into the glob, we'll only ever get an
undefined value when an undefined slot is accessed. But if we were to
use SCALAR instead of FOO then the $scalar variable would contain "the
FOO data type".

Another thing to be noted from the above example is that you can't
assign to glob slots directly, only through dereferencing them.

## this is fine as we're dereferencing the stored reference
${ *foo{SCALAR} } = "a string";

## this will generate a compile-time error
*foo{SCALAR} = "a string";

__output__

Can't modify glob elem in scalar assignment at - line 5, near ""a stri
+ng";"


As one might imagine having to dereference a glob with the correct data
every time one wants to assign to a glob can be tedious and
occasionally prohibitive. Thankfully, globs come with some of perl's
yet to be patented Magic, so that when you assign to a glob the correct
slot will be filled depending on the datatype being used in the
assignment e.g

*foo = \"a scalar";
print $foo, "\n";

*foo = [ qw( a list of strings ) ];
print @foo, "\n";


*foo = sub { "a subroutine" };
print foo(), "\n";

__output__

a scalar
alistofstrings
a subroutine


Note that we're using references there as globs only contain
references, not the ac
